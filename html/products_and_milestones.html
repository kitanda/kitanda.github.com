                    Kitanda is a software stack made up of a number of
                    services that are designed to work together but
                    which can also be deployed in isolation. Our
                    vision is for the entire stack to cover all the
                    main business functions such as - but not limited
                    to - Market Data, Pricing, Booking, Risk
                    Management, Reporting and Confirmations. This page
                    is the map on the road to that vision.

                    Kitanda's vision for financial markets is embodied
                    in two main projects - currently at different
                    stages of development: <span
                    class="text-info"><strong>Dogen</strong></span>,
                    Kitanda's code generator, and <span

                    the distributed risk engine. Below you can find an
                    overview of the current state of these products,
                    their main milestones and the development

                                <strong>Dogen</strong> is a code
                                generator designed to target domain
                                models. It is crucial for Kitanda
                                because we use a intensively <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">domain
                                driven</a> approach to software
                                engineering, resulting in a very large
                                number of domain specific
                                <i>languages</i>. Dogen was created to
                                make the modeling process simpler: the
                                user creates a domain model using a
                                UML tool and Dogen uses it to generate
                                its source code representation. The
                                generated code contains most of the
                                services required from a typical C++
                                domain object such as serialisation,
                                hashing, streaming and so on.

                                <br/><br/>

                                The main objective of creating a
                                domain generator is to avoid having to
                                maintain manually a significant amount
                                of trivial code; this not only speeds
                                up the development process but it also
                                improves quality as programmers do not
                                tend to perform repetitive tasks
                                terribly well.  We developed our own
                                domain generator because we could not
                                find one that fitted our requirements
                                - open source or otherwise.

                                Note that Dogen is specifically
                                tailored for our needs and as such it
                                is not a general purpose domain
                                generator. We are, however, wiling to
                                accept any patches for functionality
                                not directly required by us.

                <p>Kitanda is an Open Source project that aims to disintermediate
                    the Financial Software industry by offering a modular approach,
                    with a suite of standard financial software components which can
                    replace expensive legacy technology with modern and competitive software.

                        <h2 class="inverse_h2 burgundy_light">Reusability</h2>
                        <p>Kitanda makes use of a wide number of Open Source
                        libraries that have been tried and tested in production
                        systems, including those in the financial domain such
                        as <a href="http://quantlib.org/index.shtml">QuantLib</a>
                        and <a href="http://www.quickfixengine.org">QuickFIX</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Continuing the tradition of reusability, we are
                        structuring the Kitanda platform as a collection of tools
                        and libraries that can be used independently or in
                        conjunction; developers can then choose the subset required
                        to solve specific problems.
                        </p>
                        <p> Finally, if you choose to do so, you can always
                        contribute code - as long as it meets our coding and testing
                        standards, we are happy to relieve the burden of maintenance
                        that companies and developers frequently face.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="span4" id="agility">
                        <h2 class="inverse_h2 burgundy_light">Agility</h2>
                        <p>We use agile internally - Scrum to be precise. This means
                        you can rely on a deliverable every two weeks, without fail,
                        and you can follow and even influence the coding process
                        directly. This means we don't have to wait six months to
                        adapt and correct our course - the feedback is almost
                        immediate. And you can also watch our demos online.</p>
                        <p>With agile we are able to avoid the traditional
                        hierarchical problems that development teams face in
                        financial environments - at times overly focused on delivery
                        and time to market, but lacking on the engineering
                        front. This is not how things are done in Kitanda: We take a
                        long term view with regards to our architecture and we're
                        not afraid to refactor aggressively.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="span4" id="performance">
                        <h2 class="inverse_h2 burgundy_light">Performance</h2>
                        <p>We strongly believe that trading systems are very much
                        like operative systems when it comes to performance: every
                        cycle counts and small optimisations in a large number of
                        computations do make a difference. In other words, it is
                        native territory.</p>
                        <p>Other languages are great to develop solutions quickly,
                        but it comes at a cost. From experience, they tend to
                        struggle when it comes to very large scalability and very
                        demanding performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>We chose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++
                        11</a> as our development language because it introduces so
                        many of the features found in higher-level languages that we
                        got so issued to over the years but still follows the C++
                        principle of "you only pay for what you use".</p>
                        <p>In addition, due to our architecture and the advent of
                        modern tooling such
                        as <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> and associated
                        <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> infrastructure, we have
                        managed to greatly reduce our write-compile-debug cycle -
                        now nearing C#-ReSharper levels.</p>
